# integer_calc-x86assembly
portfolio project for CS271 - Computer Architecture & Assembly Language

This program prompts the user for 10 integer values that fall within a specific range (fits inside a 32-bit register). An error message is displayed if the user provides invalid input. After the integers are gathered, the program calculates the sum and average of the inputs. It then converts all the integers, their sum, and average, to strings and displayes them as output with header descriptions for each.
